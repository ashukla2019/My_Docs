/*
A binary tree: has at most two children.
complete binary tree: Every node should have 2 children except last lavel but should have data from
left to right.

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
It follows the Heap Property –

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
A heap can be implemented in 2 ways –

Tree Node Implementation with pointers
Heap as Array Implementation
Applications –

Some Applications of Heap are :

Heapsort sorting algorithm
Graph algorithms like – Prim’s minimal-spanning-tree algorithm and Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm.
A priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods.
