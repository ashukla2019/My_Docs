/*
//Thread creation in C++11:
In every C++ application there is one default main thread i.e. main() function. 
In C++ 11 we can create additional threads by creating objects of std::thread class.
Each of the std::thread object can be associated with a thread.
*/

/*
What std::thread accepts in constructor ?
We can attach a callback with the std::thread object, that will be executed when this new thread starts. These callbacks can be,
1.) Function Pointer
2.) Function Objects
3.) Lambda functions
4.) Non static member function
5.) Static member function

Thread objects can be created like this: std::thread thObj(<CALLBACK>);
New Thread will start just after the creation of new object and will execute the passed callback
in parallel to thread that has started it.
Moreover, any thread can wait for another to exit by calling join() function 
on that threadâ€™s object.
