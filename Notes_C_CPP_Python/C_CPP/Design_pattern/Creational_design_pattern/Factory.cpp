/*
Factory Design pattern: 
Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
